# Javascript-Project (actual project name TBD)

An interactive game where users can click on 3D objects representing parts of a fictional life story and progress through the game to reach "good" vs "bad" endings. 

## Technologies

This project will be written using three.js for rendering 3D content onto the page and vanilla JS for implementing most of the game logic.
